But don't avoid all physical activity. Ice. Even if you're seeking medical help, ice the area immediately. You can treat most muscle strains with at-home methods of first aid, including: Rest: Stop the physical activity that caused your strain to avoid further damaging your muscle. Ice: Apply an ice pack or cold compress for 10 to 15 minutes every hour for the first day after your injury. After one day, you can apply ice every three to four hours. Treatments Risks Prevention The RICE (rest, ice, compress, elevate) method is the most common way to treat mild muscle strains, but there are other approaches. More severe cases may need... Mild to moderate strains can be successfully treated at home with ice, heat, and anti-inflammatory medications. Severe strains or tears may require medical treatment. Symptoms of muscle... Answer: Rest the strained muscle and apply ice for the first few days after the injury. Anti-inflammatory medicines or acetaminophen (Tylenol) also help reduce pain and swelling. As the pain decreases, you can use heat on the muscle. Stretching and light exercises to bring blood to the injured area can also be useful.\""
